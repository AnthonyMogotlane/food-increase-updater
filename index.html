          Food increase affects customers daily and according to STATS SA The
          food and non-alcoholic beverages product group was the second-largest
          contributor to the annual inflation rate in August, recording an
          increase of 6.9%. This is the highest level of food inflation since
          June 2017, when it was also 6.9%.. Therefore with food price checker
