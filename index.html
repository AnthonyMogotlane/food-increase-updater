        The year-on-year increase outstrips headline inflation, and even food
        inflation tracked by Stats SA. The latest Consumer Price Index for March
        2022 shows that headline inflation is 5.9%, and food inflation was
        recorded at 6.7%. According to the PMBEJD, the cost of the household
        food basket continues to rise due to both global and local factors, with
        worse still to come. Therefore with food price checker we allow
        customers to keep in track with the food inflation so that they can be
        able to plan ahead for their budget.
